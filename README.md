# TASK DESCRIPTION

In this project i have develop a conceptual prototype for a home automation system to control lights and fans using the Cadio IoT platform, building upon the strengths you mentioned in your previous description.

**Core Components:**

**Microcontroller:**

ESP8266: As you've highlighted, this is a suitable choice due to its integrated Wi-Fi and low cost.

**Relay Modules:**

5V Relay Modules: To switch the AC power to the lights and fans based on signals from the ESP8266. You'll need separate relays for each device you want to control.

**Lights and Fans:**

Standard household AC-powered lights and fans.

**Power Supply:**

- 5V Power Supply: To power the ESP8266 and the relay modules.
- AC Power Source: For the lights and fans.
